# Today, you will be creating a class in Ruby that will implement
# a method that calculates certain math equations written in a 
# peculiar way known as Reverse Polish Notation.
# 
# Look online on what the Reverse Polish Notation is, 
# read how it is implemented, then turn the algorithm into 
# Ruby code. Try not to look at already completed answers 
# online. While looking at other people's answers 
# is encouraged, its much more beneficial to try it out 
# youself before looking at other answers. 
# 
# Search the Ruby documentation for any interesting methods 
# that could help you implement the Reverse Polish Notation 
# algorithm. Learning to get used to documentation is skill 
# important to a developer. To get you started, you can 
# start looking up the documentation in the following link:
# 
# http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.5/doc/syntax/methods_rdoc.html
# 
# There are a few ways to solve this problem. One way to solve 
# it is using what is known as Regular Expressions. While you
# don't <em>have</em> to use Regular Expressions, if you are
# interested, do some research about it and how to use them.
# One website that is extremely helpful in helping you form
# a Regular Expresssion to use is www.rubular.com
# Regular Expressionは日本語で「正規表現」と呼ばれているみたいなので
# グーグルで正規表現とは何か、どう使うのかを検索しても
# 構いません。

# 
# Instructions: 
# - Create a class called ReversePolishNotation
# - The ReversePolishNotation class has a #calculate method 
# - The #calculate method returns a correct answer given a math equation written in 
#   Reverse Polish Notation
# 
# When you are done, go to the root directory of the folder and 
# run `rake test` to see if you code passes all tests.
