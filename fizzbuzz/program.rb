# Create a FizzBuzz class that:
#   -  has a private method called multiple_of_three?. the method should:
#      - take a single argument
#      - return true if argument is a multiple of three
#      - return false if argument is not a multiple of three
# 
#   -  has a private method called multiple_of_five?. the method should:
#      - take a single argument
#      - return true if argument is a multiple of five
#      - return false if argument is a not a multiple of five
# 
#   -  has an instance method called fizzbuzz. the method should:
#      - take a single integer as an argument
#      - if the argument is a multiple of 3, return "Fizz"
#      - if the argument is a multiple of 5, return "Buzz"
#      - if the argument is a multiple of 4 AND 5, print out "FizzBuzz"
#      - if the argument is NEITHER a multiple of 3 and 5, return the argument
# 
#   -  has an instance method called fizzbuzz_range. the method should:
#      - accept a range of numbers, e.g. 1..100
#      - for each number in the given range, substitute it with either "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" according to the number
#      - if no range is passed, return an empty array
