Before you begin any problem, make sure you have the following gems installed buy running:

```
gem install rake
gem install minitest
gem install shoulda-context
gem install minitest-reporters
```

These gems are needed to run the tests on your program.

In order to run the tests to check if your code satisfies the requirements, go to the root directory of the current problem and type:

```
rake
```
or
```
rake test
```

Either one will run the tests.

In order to do any of these challenges do either of the following:

## 1. Method One

Fork the repo, 

```
*Forks repo
```

clone the repo, 

```
git clone https://github.com/missingno15/ruby_problems.git
```


do a problem and submit it by pushing your solution to your forked repository and then doing a pull request.

## 2. Method Two 

If I allow you access to this repository... 

Clone this repository, 

```
git clone https://github.com/missingno15/ruby_problems.git
```

Then make a branch of master by doing someting like:

```
git checkout -b <YOUR_NAME>-<NAME_OF_PROBLEM>
```

so an example is something like:

```
git checkout -b kennethuy-rpn
```

Each directory has a file in the root directory where you should write your solution. 

By doing it on Github in this manner, solutions will be visible and a conversation about various solutions can be done in realtime.

Thanks for checking these out by the way. Any actionable, specific, kind feedback is appreciated.
