Before you begin any problem, make sure you have the following gems installed

```ruby
gem install rake
gem install minitest
gem install shoulda-context
gem install minitest-reporters
```

These gems are needed to run the tests on your program.

In order to run the tests to check if your code satisfies the requirements, go to the root directory of the current problem and type:

```shell
rake
```
or
```shell
rake test
```

Either one will run the tests.

In order to do any of these challenges do either of the following:

## 1. Method One

Fork the repo, clone it to your desktop, do a problem and submit it by pushing your solution to your forked repository and then doing a pull request. DO NOT MERGE OR I WILL DO MEAN THINGS TO YOU.

## 2. Method Two 

If I allow you to, clone this repository, make a branch of master by doing someting like:

```shell
git checkout -b <YOUR_NAME>-<NAME_OF_PROBLEM>
```

so an example is something like:

```shell
git checkout -b kennethuy-rpn
```

By doing it on Github in this manner, solutions will be visible and a conversation about various solutions can be done in realtime.
